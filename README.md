## 1. Executive Summary  
Amazon ECS enables organizations to run containerized workloads without managing Kubernetes complexity. However, containerized applications in production face risks during deployments—ranging from faulty images to service crashes and misconfigured task definitions. Rollback and incident response in ECS must therefore be tightly integrated with deployment strategies, observability pipelines, and governance controls.  

This document presents a **resilience playbook** to handle ECS incidents effectively. It covers **rollback mechanisms (task definition revisions, service redeployment, blue/green deployments), incident workflows (detection, triage, containment, resolution), and traffic control** using Application Load Balancers (ALB) or Service Mesh.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Rollback in ECS is primarily managed via **task definition revisions** and **deployment configurations**.  
- Incident response must focus on **fast triage, controlled redeployments, and minimal traffic disruption**.  
- Blue/green and canary deployments via **ECS + CodeDeploy** drastically improve rollback agility.  
- Governance, compliance, and RCA discipline are as important as the technical fix.

## 2. Scope  
- **Applies to:** ECS workloads running in production (both EC2 launch type and Fargate).  
- **Focus areas:** Rollback execution, incident lifecycle, traffic stability.  
- **Excludes:** Kubernetes (covered separately) and serverless Lambda workloads.

## 3. ECS Rollback Strategies  

### 3.1 Task Definition Revisions  
ECS creates a **new revision** whenever a task definition is updated. Rollback simply means updating the ECS service to use a **previous stable revision**.  
- **Pro:** Quick and reversible.  
- **Con:** Cannot revert database/schema changes automatically.  

### 3.2 Service Deployment Configurations  
- ECS supports **minimumHealthyPercent** and **maximumPercent** parameters during updates.  
- Example: Set `minimumHealthyPercent=100` and `maximumPercent=200` → ensures zero-downtime deployments.  
- Rollback = redeploy service with previous revision.  

### 3.3 Blue/Green Deployments via CodeDeploy  
- ECS integrates with **AWS CodeDeploy** to perform blue/green updates.  
- New tasks (green) are launched alongside old tasks (blue).  
- Traffic is shifted gradually through ALB target groups.  
- Rollback = instant shift back to blue environment.  

**Comparison Table:**  

| Strategy                 | Speed of Rollback | Risk Exposure | Complexity | Use Case                               |
|---------------------------|------------------|--------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Task Definition Revision | Fast             | Medium       | Low        | Quick fixes for faulty images/config   |
| Service Redeployment     | Moderate         | Medium       | Medium     | Application-level misconfiguration     |
| Blue/Green Deployment    | Instant          | Very Low     | High       | Business-critical, zero-downtime apps  |

## 4. Incident Response Workflow  

### 4.1 Lifecycle  
1. **Detection** – CloudWatch alarms, Container Insights, ALB health checks.  
2. **Triage** – Identify scope (service-level or cluster-wide).  
3. **Containment** – Scale down faulty tasks, rollback to prior revision, shift traffic.  
4. **Resolution** – Patch container image or fix IAM/Networking issues.  
5. **Postmortem** – RCA, corrective actions, update runbooks.  

### 4.2 Severity Classification  

| Severity | Impact                                   | Example Case                           | Action                                |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| SEV-1    | Major outage, >50% tasks failing          | All tasks crash after image deploy      | Immediate rollback to prior revision  |
| SEV-2    | Partial outage, degraded latency/throughput| ALB shows 40% unhealthy targets         | Reduce traffic, rollback, monitor     |
| SEV-3    | Minor issue, localized service disruption | One ECS service misconfigured           | Redeploy service, observe             |

## 5. Roles & Responsibilities  

- **DevOps Engineers:** Rollback task definitions, manage deployments, monitor stability.  
- **SRE Team:** Coordinate incident bridge calls, act as incident commanders.  
- **Developers:** Debug application code, rebuild fixed Docker images.  
- **Network/Security Teams:** Validate ALB/NLB configs, IAM roles, security groups.  
- **Leadership:** Communicate outage updates to business stakeholders.  

---

## 6. Traffic Management Principles  

**Core Guidelines:**  
- Use **ALB target groups** to decouple traffic from ECS tasks.  
- Maintain **blue and green target groups** for safer cutovers.  
- Automate rollbacks with **CodeDeploy + CloudWatch alarms**.  
- Leverage **Service Auto Scaling** to handle traffic bursts during rollback.  

Example: If new tasks fail health checks > 20% for 5 minutes, CodeDeploy reverts traffic to stable target group automatically.  

---

## 7. Case Study: Rollback in ECS Production  
An ECS Fargate service is updated with a new Docker image. Within minutes, ALB marks 60% of targets as unhealthy. CloudWatch alarms fire, and PagerDuty alerts the on-call engineer. The incident commander declares SEV-1. Rollback is executed by pointing the ECS service back to the last stable task definition revision. Within 3 minutes, traffic stabilizes. Postmortem identifies a missing environment variable in the new container image, prompting the addition of automated image validation checks in the CI/CD pipeline.  

---

## 8. Governance & Compliance  

- All ECS rollbacks must be logged in **incident tracking systems** (e.g., ServiceNow).  
- RCA reports must include task definition revision IDs and deployment logs.  
- ECS activity (task/service updates) is auditable via **CloudTrail**.  
- Security and compliance checks must validate IAM role changes during rollback.

| Focus Area              | Best Practice                             | Rollback Method                          |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Deployment Safety        | Use min/max healthy % configs             | Service redeploy with prior revision     |

| Observability            | CloudWatch, Container Insights, ALB checks| Errors drive rollback triggers           |
| Governance               | RCA, audit logs, ServiceNow/JIRA tickets  | Compliance enforced via CloudTrail        |

## 10. Conclusion  
ECS provides scalable container orchestration, but resilience depends on **rollback agility and incident readiness**. By leveraging task definition revisions, deployment configurations, and blue/green rollouts, teams can achieve near-zero downtime even during faulty deployments. Coupled with structured incident workflows, observability, and compliance enforcement, this framework ensures both **technical resilience** and **organizational trust**.
